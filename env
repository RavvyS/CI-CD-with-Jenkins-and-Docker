lets begin with a workstation , lets think you workstation is your lap which docker installed on it.
alternativtely we can make a clude base server , anyway in your local workstation this will work fine.
lest imagine you have a two container , one is act as a jetkins server and second will act as a docker server (DIND) [docker inside a docker we call it as a DIND]

Setting up and configuring jenkins server

you can run docker locally or cloud base. 
after you run it you can find out that you did all the steps correctly using 
"docker version" command , when you wrote it you can see client and server side in terminal.
